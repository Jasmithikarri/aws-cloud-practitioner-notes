EC2 Instance Types - General Purpose
	• ﻿﻿Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
	• ﻿﻿Balance between:
	• ﻿﻿Compute
	• ﻿﻿Memory
	• ﻿﻿Networking
	• ﻿﻿In the course, we will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 instance
EC2 Instance Types - Compute Optimized
	• ﻿﻿Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
	• ﻿﻿Batch processing workloads
	• ﻿﻿Media transcoding
	• ﻿﻿High performance web servers
	• ﻿﻿High performance computing (HPC)
	• ﻿﻿Scientific modeling & machine learning
	• ﻿﻿Dedicated gaming servers
EC2 Instance Types - Memory Optimized
	• ﻿﻿Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
	• ﻿﻿Use cases:
	• ﻿﻿High performance, relational/non-relational databases
	• ﻿﻿Distributed web scale cache stores
	• ﻿﻿In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
	• ﻿﻿Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
EC2 Instance Types - Storage Optimized
	• ﻿﻿Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
	• ﻿﻿Use cases:
	• ﻿﻿High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
	• ﻿﻿Relational & NoSQL databases
	• ﻿﻿Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
	• ﻿﻿Data warehousing applications
	• ﻿﻿Distributed file systems
 to Security Groups
	• ﻿﻿Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
	• ﻿﻿They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances
	• ﻿﻿Security groups only contain allow rules
	• ﻿﻿Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
Classic Ports to know
	• ﻿﻿22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
	• ﻿﻿21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
	• ﻿﻿22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
	• ﻿﻿80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites
	• ﻿﻿443 = HTTPS - access secured websites
	• ﻿3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance
EC2  Instances Purchasing Options
	• ﻿﻿On-Demand Instances - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
	• ﻿﻿Reserved (1 & 3 years)
	• Reserved Instances - long workloads
	• ﻿﻿Convertible Reserved Instances - long workloads with flexible instances
	• ﻿﻿Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) -commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
	• ﻿﻿Spot Instances - short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
 On Demand
	• ﻿﻿Pay for what you use:
	• ﻿﻿Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
	• ﻿﻿All other operating systems - billing per hour
	• ﻿﻿Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
	• ﻿﻿No long-term commitment
	• ﻿﻿Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave
EC2 Reserved Instances
	• ﻿﻿Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
	• ﻿﻿You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
	• ﻿﻿Reservation Period - I year (+discount) or 3 years (++ + discount)
	• ﻿﻿Payment Options - No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
	• ﻿﻿Reserved Instance's Scope - Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AL)
	• ﻿﻿Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
	• ﻿﻿You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
Convertible Reserved Instance
	• ﻿﻿Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
	• ﻿﻿Up to 66% discount
EC2 Savings Plans
	• ﻿﻿Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as R/s)
	• ﻿﻿Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for | or 3 years)
	• ﻿﻿Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
	• ﻿﻿Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-I)
	• ﻿﻿Flexible across:
	• ﻿﻿Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
	• ﻿﻿OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
	• ﻿﻿Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

EC2 Spot Instances
	• ﻿﻿Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
	• ﻿﻿Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less than th current spot price
	• ﻿﻿The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
	• ﻿﻿Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
	• ﻿﻿Batch jobs
	• ﻿﻿Data analysis
	• ﻿﻿Image processing
	• ﻿﻿Any distributed workloads
	• ﻿﻿Workloads with a flexible start and end time
	• ﻿﻿Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

Type	Best For	Discount Potential	Commitment
On-Demand	Spiky/Unpredictable workloads	None	No commitment
Reserved Instances	Steady, predictable workloads	Up to 75%	1-3 years commitment
Spot Instances	Flexible, fault-tolerant workloads	Up to 90%	Interruptible workloads
Savings Plans	Predictable workloads with flexibility	Up to 66%	1-3 years commitment

EC2 Dedicated Hosts
	• ﻿﻿A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
	• ﻿﻿Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe VM software licenses)
	• ﻿﻿Purchasing Options:
	• ﻿﻿On-demand - pay per second for active Dedicated Host
	• ﻿﻿Reserved - I or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
	• ﻿﻿The most expensive option
	• ﻿﻿Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - Bring Your Own License
	• ﻿﻿Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs
EC2 Dedicated Instances
	• ﻿﻿Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you
	• ﻿﻿May share hardware with other instances in same account
	• ﻿﻿No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)
EC2 Capacity Reservations
	• ﻿﻿Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
	• ﻿﻿You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
	• ﻿﻿No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
	• ﻿﻿Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
	• ﻿﻿You're charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
	• ﻿﻿Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

Combination	                               Cost Savings	                Flexibility	                           Best for
Capacity Reservations + RI	Up to 75% off	Fixed instance type and region	Long-term, predictable workloads
Capacity Reservations + Savings Plans	Up to 66% off	Flexible instance types and regions	Long-term but dynamic workloads
Capacity Reservations + On-Demand	No discount	Fully flexible	Short-term, unpredictable workloads

• Reserved Instances offer higher savings than Savings Plans if your workload is fixed and predictable.
• Savings Plans are more flexible if your workload changes often (e.g., different instance types, regions, or operating systems).
• Using On-Demand instances with Capacity Reservations is the most expensive option but ensures capacity when needed for critical workloads.
