VPC is a Virtual Private Cloud that you can create and configure to run AWS resources such as AWS EC2, AWS RDS and other services. It allows you to define your own IP address range, subnets, route tables and internet gateways.


SUBNETS: Partitions inside the VPC are called as subnets

ROUTE TABLE: It controls the traffic between the Subnets and Internet gateway.

INTERNET GATEWAY: It allows you to communicate with internet to make publicly accessible to everyone.

STEP1: create VPC(MYVPC) 
STEP2: create 2 subnets. 1-webSN , 2-DBSn
STEP3: make subnet public 
Step4:Create internet gateway
STEP5: create routetable attach one end of the routetable to VPC(edit subnet assosications) and another end to Internetgateway(edit routes)
STEP6:create EC2 machine 1- webserver attach MYVPC and webSN  and open 2 ports SSH and HHTP(anywhere)give USER DATA.
STEP7:EC2 machine 2- DBserver attach MYVPC and dbSN  and open 1 port MYSQL(PUBLIC SUBNET IP) give USER DATA.

NOTE: to transfer data from public subnet(bastion server) to private subnet(DBSN) we need to open MYSQL() and SSH(PUBLIC SUBNET IP).
NAT GATEWAY:
If you want your private subnet to access to internet, software installments then we use this NAT gateway. This allows the inbound traffic and blocks the outbound traffic.
IP Addresses in AWS
	• ﻿﻿IPv4 - Internet Protocol version 4 (4.3 Billion Addresses)
	• ﻿﻿Public IPv4 - can be used on the Internet
	• ﻿﻿EC2 instance gets a new a public IP address every time you stop then start it (default)
	• ﻿﻿Private IPv4 - can be used on private networks (LAN) such as internal AWS networking (e.g., |92.|68.l.)
	• ﻿﻿Private IPv4 is fixed for EC2 Instances even if you start/stop them
     • Elastic IP - allows you to attach a fixed public IPv4 address to EC2 instance
	• ﻿﻿Note: all public IPv4 on AWS will be charged $0.005 per hour (including EIP)
	• ﻿﻿Free Tier: 750 hours usage per month
	• ﻿﻿IPv6 - Internet Protocol version 6 (3.4 x 1038 Addresses)
	• ﻿﻿Every IP address is public in AWS (no private range)
	• ﻿﻿Example: 200l :db8:3333:4444:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff
	• ﻿﻿Free

VPC & Subnets Primer
	• ﻿﻿VPC -Virtual Private Cloud: private network to deploy your resources regional resource
	• ﻿﻿Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC
(Availability Zone resource)
	• ﻿﻿A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
	• ﻿﻿A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
	• ﻿﻿To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.

Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
	• ﻿﻿Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
	• ﻿﻿Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
Public S
• NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private

• Internet Gateway (IGW):
	• Allows your VPC to connect to the internet.
	• Typically used with public subnets.
• Route Table:
	• Directs traffic to the appropriate target (e.g., IGW, VGW, NAT Gateway).
	• Public subnets have routes pointing to the IGW, while private subnets might point to a NAT Gateway or VGW.
• Virtual Private Gateway (VGW):
	• Connects your VPC to your on-premises network or other external networks securely.
	• Used in hybrid cloud scenarios.

Network ACL & Security Groups
	• ﻿﻿NACL (Network ACL)
	• ﻿﻿A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
	• ﻿﻿Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
	• ﻿﻿Are attached at the Subnet level
	• ﻿﻿Rules only include IP addresses
﻿﻿Security Groups
	• ﻿﻿A firewall that controls traffic to and from an EC2
Instance
	• ﻿﻿Can have only ALLOW rules
	• ﻿﻿Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

Network ACLs vs Security Groups
Security Group	Network ACL
Operates at the instance level	Operates at the subnet level
Supports allow rules only	Supports allow rules and deny rules
Is stateful: Return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules	Is stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules
We evaluate all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic	We process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow traffic
Applies to an instance only if someone specifies the security group when launching the instance, or associates the security group with the instance later on	Automatically applies to all instances in the subnets it's associated with (therefore, you don't have to rely on users to specify the security group)

VPC Flow Logs
	• ﻿﻿Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
	• ﻿﻿VPC Flow Logs
	• ﻿﻿Subnet Flow Logs
	• ﻿﻿Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
	• ﻿﻿Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example:
	• ﻿﻿Subnets to internet
	• ﻿﻿Subnets to subnets
	• ﻿﻿Internet to subnets
	• ﻿﻿Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load
Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc...
	• ﻿﻿VPC Flow logs data can go to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehose
VPC Peering
	• ﻿﻿Connect two VPC, privately using
AWS' network
	• ﻿﻿Make them behave as if they were in the same network
	• ﻿﻿Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP
address range)
	• ﻿﻿VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to
communicate with one another)
VPC Endpoints
	• ﻿﻿Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS
Services using a private network instead of the public www network
	• ﻿﻿This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
	• ﻿﻿VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
	• ﻿﻿VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest

AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services)
	• ﻿﻿Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPCs
	• ﻿﻿Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables...
	• ﻿﻿Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI elastic network interface(Customer VPC)

Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
	• ﻿﻿Site to Site VPN
	• ﻿﻿Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS
	• ﻿﻿The connection is automatically encrypted
	• ﻿﻿Goes over the public internet
﻿﻿Direct Connect (DX)
	• ﻿﻿Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
	• ﻿﻿The connection is private, secure and fast
	• ﻿﻿Goes over a private network
	• Takes at least a month to establish
	• AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated physical connection between on-premises environments and AWS.
	• While it offers secure communication, it does not use IPSec encryption and is typically used for higher bandwidth and lower latency needs.
	• 
Site-to-Site VPN
	• ﻿﻿On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway (CGW)
	• ﻿﻿AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway
(VGW)

• AWS Client VPN
	• ﻿﻿Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to your private network in AWS and on-premises
	• ﻿﻿Allow you to connect to your EC2 instances over a private IP (just as if you were in the private VPC network)
	• ﻿﻿Goes over public Internet

• Transit Gateway
	• ﻿﻿For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star)
	• connection
	• ﻿﻿One single Gateway to provide this functionality
	• ﻿﻿Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections
