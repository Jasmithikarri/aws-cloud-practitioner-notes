Why make a global application?
	• ﻿﻿A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
	• ﻿﻿On AWS: this could be Regions and / or Edge Locations
﻿﻿Decreased Latency
	• ﻿﻿Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
	• ﻿﻿It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US
	• ﻿﻿Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience
﻿﻿Disaster Recovery (DR)
	• ﻿﻿If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)...
	• ﻿﻿You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working
	• ﻿﻿A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application
Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack
Global Applications in AWS
Global DNS: Route 53(Health checks)
	• ﻿﻿Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
	• ﻿﻿Great for disaster recovery strategies
Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
	• ﻿﻿Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations - decrease latency
	• ﻿﻿Cache common requests - improved user experience and decreased latency
S3 Transfer Acceleration
	• ﻿﻿Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3
AWS Global Accelerator:
	• ﻿﻿Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
Amazon Route 53 Overview
	• ﻿﻿Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
	• ﻿﻿DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
	• ﻿﻿In AWS, the most common records are:
	• ﻿﻿www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 == A record (IPv4)
	• ﻿﻿www.google.com => 200l:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 == AAAA IPv6
	• ﻿﻿search.google.com => www.google.com == CNAME: hostname to hostname
	• ﻿﻿example.com => AWS resource == Alias (ex: ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc...)

Disaster Recovery


• Simple Routing:
	• Basic routing where all traffic is sent to a single endpoint.
	• Example: Everyone visiting mywebsite.com goes to the same server.
• Weighted Routing:
	• Splits traffic between multiple servers based on assigned weights.
	• Example: 70% of traffic goes to Server A, and 30% goes to Server B.
• Latency-Based Routing:
	• Sends users to the server with the lowest latency (fastest response time).
	• Example: A user in the US goes to a US server, while a user in Asia goes to an Asia server.
• Failover Routing:
	• Automatically redirects traffic to a backup server if the main server goes down.
	• Example: If Server A fails, traffic is sent to Server B.


AWS CloudFront(Global Reach)
	• ﻿﻿Content Delivery Network (CDN)
	• ﻿﻿Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
	• ﻿﻿Improves users experience
	• ﻿﻿216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
	• ﻿﻿DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall
CloudFront - Origins
	• ﻿﻿S3 bucket
	• ﻿﻿For distributing files and caching them at the edge
	• ﻿﻿Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
	• ﻿﻿OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAl)
	• ﻿﻿CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
	• ﻿﻿Custom Origin (HTTP)
	• ﻿﻿Application Load Balancer
	• ﻿﻿EC2 instance
	• ﻿﻿S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
	• ﻿﻿Any HTTP backend you want
CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
CloudFront:
	• ﻿﻿Global Edge network
	• ﻿﻿Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
	• ﻿﻿Great for static content that must be available everywhere
﻿﻿S3 Cross Region Replication:
	• ﻿﻿Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen Mostly for FAilover
	• ﻿﻿Files are updated in near real-time
	• ﻿﻿Read only
	• ﻿﻿Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
S3 Transfer Acceleration
• Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region

AWS Global Accelerator
	• ﻿﻿Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
	• ﻿﻿Leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application (60% improvement)
	• ﻿﻿2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through
Edge Locations
	• ﻿﻿The Edge locations send the traffic to your application
AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
	• ﻿﻿They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
	• ﻿﻿Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
﻿﻿CloudFront - Content Delivery Network
	• ﻿﻿Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
	• ﻿﻿Content is served at the edge
﻿﻿Global Accelerator
	• ﻿﻿No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regic
	• ﻿﻿Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
	• ﻿﻿Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
	• ﻿﻿Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

Purpose	Global traffic routing for performance & availability	Content delivery & caching
Best for	Applications with global users, high availability, and low-latency access	Websites, media streaming, static/dynamic content
Traffic Routing	Routes traffic to healthy regional endpoints based on latency	Routes traffic to the nearest edge location for cached content
Caching	   Does not cache content	                                                     Caches static and dynamic content at edge locations
Health Monitoring	Monitors health of application endpoints and provides failover	No built-in health monitoring for content delivery
Failover	Automatic failover to healthy endpoints	Edge locations handle failover, but no regional failover
IP Addressing	Static IP addresses (Anycast)	                                  No static IPs; uses dynamic IPs

AWS Outposts
	• ﻿﻿Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
	• ﻿﻿Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems:
	• ﻿﻿One for the AWS cloud using the AWS console,
CLI, and AWS APls)
	• ﻿﻿One for their on-premises infrastructure
	• ﻿﻿AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWs infrastructure, services, APls & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
	• ﻿﻿AWs will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises intrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
	• ﻿﻿You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security
AWS Outposts
	• ﻿﻿Benefits:
	• ﻿﻿Low-latency access to on-premises systems
	• ﻿﻿Local data processing
	• ﻿﻿Data residency
	• ﻿﻿Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
	• ﻿﻿Fully managed service
	• ﻿﻿Some services that work on Outposts:
AWS WaveLength
	• ﻿﻿WaveLength Lones are intrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications providers' datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
	• ﻿﻿Brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks
	• ﻿﻿Example: EC2, EBS, VPC...
	• ﻿﻿Ultra-low latency applications through 5G networks
	• ﻿﻿Traffic doesn't leave the Communication Service
Provider's (CSP) network
	• ﻿﻿High-bandwidth and secure connection to the parent
AWS Region
	• ﻿﻿No additional charges or service agreements

Connected Vehicles, Interactive Live Video Streams, AR/R,
Real-time Gaming, ...
AWS Local Zones
	• ﻿﻿Places AWS compute, storage, database, and other selected AWS services closer to end users to run latency-sensitive applications
	• ﻿﻿Extend your VPC to more locations -"Extension of an AWS Region"
	• ﻿﻿Compatible with EC2, RDS, ECS, EBS, ElastiCache, Direct Connect ...
	• ﻿﻿Example:
