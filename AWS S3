Amazon S3 - Buckets
	• ﻿﻿Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
	• ﻿﻿Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
	• ﻿﻿Buckets are defined at the region level
	• ﻿﻿S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
	• ﻿﻿Naming convention
	• ﻿﻿No uppercase, No underscore
	• ﻿﻿3-63 characters long
	• ﻿﻿Not an IP
	• ﻿﻿Must start with lowercase letter or number
	• ﻿﻿Must NOT start with the prefix xn--S3 Bucket
      • Must NOT end with the suffix -salias
Amazon S3 - Objects (cont.)
	• ﻿﻿Object values are the content of the body:
	• ﻿﻿Max. Object Size is 5 TB (5000GB)
	• ﻿﻿If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
	• ﻿﻿Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
	• ﻿﻿Tags (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle »
	• ﻿﻿Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
Amazon S3 - Security
	• ﻿﻿User-Based
	• ﻿﻿IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
	• ﻿﻿Resource-Based
	• ﻿﻿Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
	• ﻿﻿Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
	• ﻿﻿Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)
	• ﻿﻿Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
	• ﻿﻿The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
	• ﻿﻿AND there's no explicit DENY
	• ﻿﻿Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys
S3 Bucket Policies
	• ﻿﻿JSON based policies
	• ﻿﻿Resources: buckets and objects
	• ﻿﻿Effect: Allow / Deny
	• ﻿﻿Actions: Set of APl to Allow or Deny
	• ﻿﻿Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to Use S3 bucket for policy to:
	• ﻿﻿Grant public access to the bucket
Bucket settings for Block Public Access
Block all public access
	• ﻿﻿These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
	• ﻿﻿If you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on
	• ﻿﻿Can be set at the account level
Amazon S3 - Static Website Hosting
• S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet
http://demo-bucket.s3-website-us-west-2
http://demo-bucket.s3-website.us-west-2
	• ﻿﻿The website URL will be (depending on the region)
	• ﻿﻿http://bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazonaws.com
	• ﻿﻿http://bucket-name.s3-website.aws-region.amazonaws.com
	• ﻿﻿If you get a 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!
Amazon S3 - Versioning
	• ﻿﻿You can version your files in Amazon S3
	• ﻿﻿It is enabled at the bucket level
	• ﻿﻿Same key overwrite will change the "version": 1, 2, 3....
	• ﻿﻿It is best practice to version your buckets
	• ﻿﻿Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
	• ﻿﻿Easy roll back to previous version
	• ﻿﻿Notes:
	• ﻿﻿Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null"
	• ﻿﻿Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
Amazon S3 - Replication (CRR & SRR)
	• ﻿﻿Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
	• ﻿﻿Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
	• ﻿﻿Same-Region Replication (SRR)
	• ﻿﻿Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
	• ﻿﻿Copying is asynchronous
	• ﻿﻿Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
asynchronous replication
	• ﻿﻿Use cases:
	• ﻿﻿CRR - compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
	• ﻿﻿SRR - log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts
S3 Durability and Availability
	• ﻿﻿Durability:
	• ﻿﻿High durability (99.999999999%, | | 9'5) of objects across multiple AZ
	• ﻿﻿If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
	• ﻿﻿Same for all storage classes
	• ﻿﻿Availability:
	• ﻿﻿Measures how readily available a service Is
	• ﻿﻿Varies depending on storage class
	• ﻿﻿Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year
S3 Standard - General Purpose
	• ﻿﻿99.99% Availability
	• ﻿﻿Used for frequently accessed data
	• ﻿﻿Low latency and high throughput
	• ﻿﻿Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
	• ﻿﻿Use Cases: Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution...
S3 Storage Classes - Infrequent Access
	• ﻿﻿For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
	• ﻿﻿Lower cost than S3 Standard
	• ﻿﻿Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
	• ﻿﻿99.9% Availability
	• ﻿﻿Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups
	• ﻿﻿Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
	• ﻿﻿High durability (99.999999999% in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed
	• ﻿﻿99.5% Availability
	• ﻿﻿Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate
Amazon S3 Glacier Storage Classes
	• ﻿﻿Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup
	• ﻿﻿Pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost

Hybrid Cloud for Storage
	• ﻿﻿AWS is pushing for "hybrid cloud"
	• ﻿﻿Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
	• ﻿﻿Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
	• ﻿﻿This can be due to
	• ﻿﻿Long cloud migrations
	• ﻿﻿Security requirements
	• ﻿﻿Compliance requirements
	• ﻿﻿IT strategy
• S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premise?

AWS Storage Gateway
	• ﻿﻿Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3
	• ﻿﻿Hybrid storage service to allow on-premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
	• ﻿﻿Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage
ENCRYPTION ENABLED BY DEFAULT.
	• ﻿﻿Types of Storage Gateway:
	• ﻿﻿File Gateway
	• ﻿﻿Volume Gateway
	• ﻿﻿Tape Gateway
	• ﻿﻿No need to know the types at the exam
