Relational Database:
Relational Database is a type of database that organizes data into structure rows and columns, where row represent record of each column and column represents a specific attribute.
RDS(RELATIONAL DATABASE):
It is managed database service provided by amazon, where users can choose any database engine like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB etc. It handles many Database routine tasks like patching,  backups, Failover and Maintenance.
RDS stands for Relational Database Service
﻿﻿It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
﻿﻿It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
﻿﻿Postgres
﻿﻿MySQL
﻿﻿MariaDB
﻿﻿Oracle
﻿﻿Microsoft SQL Server
﻿﻿IBM DB2
﻿﻿Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
	• ﻿﻿RDS is a managed service:
	• ﻿﻿Automated provisioning, OS patching
	• ﻿﻿Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
	• ﻿﻿Monitoring dashboards integrated with Cloud Watch
	• ﻿﻿Read replicas for improved read performance
	• ﻿﻿Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
	• ﻿﻿Maintenance windows for upgrades
	• ﻿﻿Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
	• ﻿﻿Storage backed by EBS
	• ﻿﻿BUT you can't SSH into your instances
Scaling Options for RDS:
	1. Vertical scaling (Scale Up): Increase the instance size (e.g., from db.t3.medium to db.m5.large).
	2. Horizontal scaling (Read Replicas): Add read replicas to distribute read traffic.


Amazon Aurora(serverless)
	• ﻿﻿Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
	• ﻿﻿PostgreSQL and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB
	• ﻿﻿Aurora is "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
	• ﻿﻿Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of IOGB, up to 128 TB
	• ﻿﻿Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient
	• Not in the free tier

Amazon Aurora Serverless
	• ﻿﻿Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
	• ﻿﻿PostgreSQL and MySQL are both supported as Aurora Serverless DB
	• ﻿﻿No capacity planning needed
	• ﻿﻿Least management overhead
	• ﻿﻿Pay per second, can be more cost-effective
	• ﻿﻿Use cases: good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads…

RDS Deployments: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ
﻿﻿Read Replicas:
	• ﻿﻿Scale the read workload of your DB
	• ﻿﻿Can create up to 15 Read Replicas
	• ﻿﻿Data is only written to the main DB
Amazon﻿﻿Multi-AZ:
	• ﻿﻿Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)
	• ﻿﻿Data is only read/written to the main database
	• ﻿﻿Can only have 1 other AZ as failover

RDS Deployments: Multi-Region
	• ﻿﻿Multi-Region (Read Replicas)
	• ﻿﻿Disaster recovery in case of region issu
	• ﻿﻿Local performance for global reads
	• ﻿﻿Replication cost

Difference Between Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora
	• Amazon Aurora is a highly performant and scalable relational database engine compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
	• Aurora is 5x faster than MySQL and 3x faster than PostgreSQL.
	• RDS supports a broader range of engines, while Aurora focuses on performance and scalability.
What is Amazon ElastiCache?
	• A fully managed in-memory data store and caching service.
	• Stores data in memory for low-latency, high-throughput access.
	• Non structured data
	• Offloads read operations from the backend database.
	• Reduces the load on your primary database, improving overall application scalability.
Caching Engines
	• Redis:
		○ Open-source, key-value store.
		○ Supports advanced data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets).
		○ Provides high availability with replication and supports backups.
		○ Enables Pub/Sub messaging for real-time updates.
	• Memcached:
		○ Simple, in-memory key-value store.
		○ Designed for horizontal scaling.
		○ Lightweight and easier to manage than Redis.

DYNAMODB:
It is a fully managed NoSQL Database. It is Key-Value and Document database that offers fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

	﻿﻿Difference with ElastiCache at the CCP level: DAX is only used for and is integrated with DynamoDB, while ElastiCache can be used for other databases
DynamoDB - Global Tables
	﻿﻿Make a DynamoDB table accessible with low latency in multiple-regions
	﻿﻿Active-Active replication (read/write to any AWS Region).
	
Redshift Overview
	﻿﻿Redshift is based on PostgreSQL, but it's not used for OLTP
	﻿﻿It's OLAP - online analytical processing (analytics and data warehousing)
	﻿﻿Load data once every hour, not every second
	﻿﻿10x better performance than other data warehouses, scale to PBs of data
