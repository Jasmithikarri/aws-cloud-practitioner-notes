What's an EBS Volume?
	• ﻿﻿An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
	• ﻿﻿It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
	• ﻿﻿They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
	• ﻿﻿They are bound to a specific availability zone
	• ﻿﻿Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"
	• ﻿﻿Free tier: 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or
Magnetic per month

EBS Volume
	• ﻿﻿It's a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
	• ﻿﻿It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit latency
	• ﻿﻿It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
	• ﻿﻿It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
	• ﻿﻿An EBS Volume in us-east-l a cannot be attached to us-east- b
	• ﻿﻿To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
	• ﻿﻿Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
	• ﻿﻿You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
EBS Snapshots
	• ﻿﻿Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
	• ﻿﻿Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
	• ﻿﻿Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region
AMI Overview
	• ﻿﻿AMI = Amazon Machine Image
	• ﻿﻿AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
	• ﻿﻿You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
	• ﻿﻿Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
	• ﻿﻿AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
	• ﻿﻿You can launch EC2 instances from:
	• ﻿﻿A Public AMI: AWS provided
	• ﻿﻿Your own AMl: you make and maintain them yourself
	• ﻿﻿An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)
AMI Process from an EC2 instance)
	• ﻿﻿Start an EC2 instance and customize it
	• ﻿﻿Stop the instance (for data integrity)
	• ﻿﻿Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
	• ﻿﻿Launch instances from other AMIs
EC2 Image Builder
	• ﻿﻿Used to automate the creation of Virtual Machines or container images
	• ﻿﻿=> Automate the creation, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs
	• ﻿﻿Can be run on a schedule (weekly, whenever packages are updated, etc...)
	• ﻿﻿Free service (only pay for the underlying resources)

EC2 Instance Store
	• ﻿﻿EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
	• ﻿﻿If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
	• ﻿﻿Better 1/0 performance
	• ﻿﻿EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
	• ﻿﻿Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
	• ﻿﻿Risk of data loss if hardware fails
EFS - Elastic File System
	• ﻿﻿Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2
	• ﻿﻿EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
	• ﻿﻿Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning
EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)
	• ﻿﻿Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day
	• ﻿﻿Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
	• ﻿﻿EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed
	• ﻿﻿Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy
	• ﻿﻿Example: move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA
	• ﻿﻿Transparent to the applications accessing EFS

Amazon FSx - Overview
	• ﻿﻿Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS
	• ﻿﻿Fully managed service
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
	• ﻿﻿A fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable Windows native shared file system
	• ﻿﻿Built on Windows File Server
	• ﻿﻿Supports SMB protocol &
Windows NTFS
	• ﻿﻿Integrated with Microsoft Active
Directory
	• ﻿﻿Can be accessed from AWS or your on-premise infrastructure

Amazon FSx for Lustre
• oluting er.hish-performance, scalable file storage for High Performance
	• ﻿﻿The name Lustre is derived from "Linux" and "cluster"
	• ﻿﻿Machine Learning, Analytics, Video Processing, Financial Modeling, ...
	• ﻿﻿Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
EC2 Instance Storage - Summary
﻿﻿EBS volumes:
	• ﻿﻿network drives attached to one EC2 instance at a time
	• ﻿﻿Mapped to an Availability Zones
	• ﻿﻿Can use EBS Snapshots for backups / transferring EBS volumes across AZ
	• ﻿﻿AMI: create ready-to-use EC2 instances with our customizations
	• ﻿﻿EC2 Image Builder: automatically build, test and distribute AMis
	• ﻿﻿EC2 Instance Store: ﻿﻿High performance hardware disk attached to our EC2 instance ﻿﻿Lost if our instance is stopped / terminated
	• ﻿﻿EFS: network file system, can be attached to 100s of instances in a region
	• ﻿﻿EFS-IA: cost-optimized storage class for infrequent accessed files
	• ﻿﻿FSx for Windows: Network File System for Windows servers
	• ﻿﻿FSx for Lustre: High Performance Computing Linux file system



Feature	EBS (Elastic Block Store)	EFS (Elastic File System)
Type of Storage	Block storage (like a hard drive)	File storage (like a shared drive)
Attachment	Can be attached to only one EC2 instance at a time	Can be attached to multiple EC2 instances at once
Scalability	Fixed size, but can be resized manually	Auto-scales as data grows (no limit)
Access	Mounted to a single EC2 instance	Mounted to multiple EC2 instances at the same time
Availability	Single Availability Zone (AZ)	Multi-AZ (accessible from different AZs)
Performance	High performance for single-instance workloads (e.g., databases)	Good for shared workloads (e.g., file storage for web servers)
Use Cases	Databases, OS storage, high-performance applications	Shared file storage for multiple instances, big data analysis
