The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
On-demand self service:
	• ﻿﻿Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
Broad network access:
	• ﻿﻿Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
	• ﻿﻿Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
	• ﻿﻿Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
Rapid elasticity and scalability:
	• ﻿﻿Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
	• ﻿﻿Quickly and easily scale based on demand
﻿﻿Measured service:
	• ﻿﻿Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used.

Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

    Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX) ﻿﻿Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
	Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
	• ﻿﻿Benefit from massive economies of scale: Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
	• ﻿﻿Stop guessing capacity: Scale based on actual measured usage
	• ﻿﻿Increase speed and agility
	• ﻿﻿Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
	• ﻿﻿Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Problems solved by the Cloud
	• ﻿﻿Flexibility: change resource types when needed
	• ﻿﻿Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
	• ﻿﻿Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
	• ﻿﻿Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
	• ﻿﻿High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
	• ﻿﻿Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

• Pricing of the Cloud - Quick Overview
	• ﻿﻿AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model
﻿﻿Compute:
	• ﻿﻿Pay for compute time
﻿﻿Storage:
	• ﻿﻿Pay for data stored in the Cloud
Data transfer OUT of the Cloud:
	• ﻿﻿Data transfer IN is free
	• ﻿﻿Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

AWS Global Infrastructure
	• ﻿﻿AWS Regions
	• ﻿﻿AWS Availability Zones
	• ﻿﻿AWS Data Centers
	• ﻿﻿AWS Edge Locations /
Points of Presence

AWS Regions
	• ﻿﻿AWS has Regions all around the world
	• ﻿﻿Names can be us-east- I, eu-west-3...
	• ﻿﻿A region is a cluster of data centers
	• ﻿﻿Most AWS services are region-scoped

How to choose an AWS Region?
If you need to launch a new application, where should you do it?
?
	• ﻿﻿Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
	• ﻿﻿Proximity to customers: reduced latency
	• ﻿﻿Available services within a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region
	• ﻿﻿Pricing: prising varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

Tour of the AWS Console
AWS has Global Services:
	• ﻿﻿Identity and Access Management (IAM)
	• ﻿﻿Route 53 (DNS service)
	• ﻿﻿CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
	• ﻿﻿WAF (Web Application Firewall)
﻿﻿Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
	• ﻿﻿Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
	• ﻿﻿Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
	• ﻿﻿Lambda (Function as a Service)
	• ﻿﻿Rekognition (Software as a Service)
